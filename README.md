# Color Detection Project
  This Python project focuses on color detection in images using computer vision and the OpenCV library. The script allows users to interactively double-click on an image to select a specific color, and the corresponding color name along with RGB values is displayed on the image. The project incorporates a color database stored in a CSV file to associate RGB values with meaningful color names.

# Dependencies
OpenCV: Used for image processing and user interface interactions.
Pandas: Utilized for managing and querying the color database.
