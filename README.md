# Color Detection Project
  This Python project focuses on color detection in images using computer vision and the OpenCV library. The script allows users to interactively double-click on an image to select a specific color, and the corresponding color name along with RGB values is displayed on the image. The project incorporates a color database stored in a CSV file to associate RGB values with meaningful color names.

# Dependencies
OpenCV: Used for image processing and user interface interactions.  
Pandas: Utilized for managing and querying the color database.

# Usage
->Install the required dependencies:  
    pip install opencv-python pandas  
->Run the color detection script:  
    python color_detection.py  
    
*Double-click on the image to interactively detect and display color information.*   

# Color Database
The color database is stored in a CSV file (colors.csv) with columns: "Color", "Color_name", "Hex", "R", "G", "B".
